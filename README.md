# Matlab_Real_Coded_Genetic_Algorithm
This code presents the real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) which is employed to design the optimal controller leading to the best possible system performance. The RCGA would go through the same steps of a binary-coded genetic algorithm (BCGA) starting with selection, crossover and finally mutation. In this particulate example, the BLX-Î± crossover is chosen to expand search space in each generation. However, a non-uniform mutation is selected over the uniform mutation to direct the search in later generations towards the optimal value. 

The main factors of a real-coded gentic algorithm:

1- Pm: mutation factor
2- Pc: crossover factor
3- alpha-factor: to perform BLX-alpha
4- beta-factor: to perform non-uniform mutation
